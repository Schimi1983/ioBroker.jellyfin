**🇩🇪 Deutsche Anleitung: [docs/de/README.md](docs/de/README.md)**

See what is playing on your [Jellyfin](https://jellyfin.org) apps and control them from ioBroker – pause the movie when the doorbell rings, dim the lights when a film starts or show the cover in your visualization.

## What you can do

- See on every Jellyfin app (TV, phone, browser) what is playing: title, series, episode, cover, position
- Start a film, a series, an episode, an album or a song by its title
- Play, pause, stop, skip forward and back, jump to a position
- Change the volume or mute
- Show a message on the TV screen (e.g. "Someone is at the door")
- Start a scan of your libraries

## What you need

- A Jellyfin server, version 12 or newer
- The Jellyfin app on the devices you want to see or control

## Setup in 3 steps

1. **Create a key in Jellyfin:** open Jellyfin in the browser → **Dashboard** → **API keys** → **+**, name it `ioBroker` and copy the key.
2. **Install the adapter** in ioBroker and open the instance settings.
3. **Enter the server address** exactly as you open Jellyfin in the browser (with port, e.g. `http://192.168.1.10:8096`) and the **key**, then save.

That's it. Every Jellyfin app that is connected to the server now appears as a device below `jellyfin.0`.

## Using the values

Each device has three folders:

| Folder | What is in it |
|---|---|
| `info` | Name of the device, app, user, whether it is connected and whether it can be controlled |
| `media` | What is playing: `state` (play / pause / stop), `title`, `series`, `season`, `episode`, `cover`, `elapsed`, `duration`, and `seek`, `volume`, `mute` |
| `command` | Buttons: `play`, `pause`, `playPause`, `stop`, `next`, `previous`, `forward`, `rewind`, `volumeUp`, `volumeDown`, `toggleMute`, `playTitle` and `message` |

**Examples**

- **Dim the light when a film starts:** react to `jellyfin.0.<device>.media.state` changing to `play`.
- **Start a film:** write its title into `jellyfin.0.<device>.command.playTitle`, e.g. `Home Alone`.
- **Pause when the doorbell rings:** set `jellyfin.0.<device>.command.pause` to `true`.
- **Message on the TV:** write the text into `jellyfin.0.<device>.command.message`.
- **Cover in VIS:** use `jellyfin.0.<device>.media.cover` as image address.
- **Jump to the middle:** write `50` into `media.seek` (percent of the film).

Below `jellyfin.0.server` you see the server version, whether an update or restart is pending, how many devices are connected and playing, and the button `refreshLibrary` to scan all libraries.

## Good to know

- **One device, two connections:** the Jellyfin apps for phones, tablets and TVs register twice with the server (the app and its player). The adapter combines both into one device: you see what the player shows and the commands go to the app.
- **A device shows "cannot be controlled"** (`info.remoteControl` = false) although the app is open: restart the app. If that does not help, log out in the app and log in again.
- **Volume** works differently on every device:

| Device | Volume value | Louder / quieter | Mute |
|---|---|---|---|
| Browser | ✔ | ✔ | ✔ |
| TV app (Fire TV, NVIDIA SHIELD, Android TV) | ✘ only a small step | ✔ | ✔ (not when the sound goes to an AV receiver) |
| Phone / tablet app | ✘ (system volume) | ✘ | ✔ |

- **Android phone app:** with the integrated player (default) you see what is playing, but the app does not accept commands. Remote control works with the **web player** (app settings) – a film started from ioBroker then waits until you tap play once on the phone.
- **iPad app:** works out of the box, a film started from ioBroker plays immediately.
- **Messages:** TV apps hide messages with a display time after 2–3 seconds, no matter which time is set. In the browser, messages without a display time stay until they are closed.
- **A device shows "not connected":** the app is closed or the device is off. As soon as the app connects again, everything updates automatically.
- A command is only sent if the app accepts it at that moment. Otherwise you find a short note in the log.
- **Old devices** are never deleted automatically, so you keep your scripts and VIS links when a device is off for a while. You can delete a device you no longer use in the **Objects** tab.
- **Option "Only show devices that can be controlled":** new devices are only added if they accept commands. Devices that already exist stay – delete them in the **Objects** tab if you do not want them.

## Questions and problems

- **"The Jellyfin server rejected the API key"** – check the key, or create a new one in the Jellyfin dashboard.
- **"Jellyfin was not found at this address"** – check the address, port and – if Jellyfin runs behind a reverse proxy – the path (e.g. `https://example.com/jellyfin`).
- **"Cannot reach the Jellyfin server"** – is the server running and reachable from the ioBroker computer?
- **"Jellyfin … is not supported"** – the adapter needs Jellyfin 12 or newer, please update the server.
- Something else? Please open an [issue](https://github.com/Schimi1983/ioBroker.jellyfin/issues) and add the log (log level *debug*).

<summary>For advanced users</summary>

### All states of a device

| State | Type | Access | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `info.name` | string | read | device name |
| `info.client` / `info.version` | string | read | app and version |
| `info.user` | string | read | Jellyfin user |
| `info.reachable` | boolean | read | session exists on the server |
| `info.remoteControl` | boolean | read | the session accepts commands right now |
| `info.lastActivity` | number | read | last activity (timestamp in ms) |
| `media.state` | string | read | `play`, `pause`, `stop` |
| `media.title`, `media.type`, `media.series`, `media.season`, `media.episode`, `media.artist`, `media.album`, `media.genre`, `media.year` | string | read | current item |
| `media.cover` | string | read | cover URL (no login needed) |
| `media.duration` / `media.elapsed` | number (s) | read | length and position |
| `media.seek` | number (%) | read/write | position in percent, write to jump |
| `media.volume` | number (%) | read/write | volume (only filled if the app reports its volume) |
| `media.mute` | boolean | read/write | mute (only filled if the app reports its volume) |
| `media.repeat` | string | read/write | `RepeatNone`, `RepeatAll`, `RepeatOne` (only filled if the app supports it) |
| `media.itemId` | string | read | Jellyfin id of the current item |
| `command.*` | boolean | write | buttons |
| `command.playTitle` | string | read/write | title (search, exact match preferred; a series starts with its first episode) or Jellyfin item id |
| `command.message` | string | read/write | text or JSON `{"text":"…","header":"…","timeoutMs":5000}` |
| `command.generalCommand` | string | read/write | any Jellyfin command, e.g. `GoHome` or `{"Name":"SetVolume","Arguments":{"Volume":"30"}}` |

Device ids: browsers use their own (shortened) id; apps are identified by app, device name and user (16-character hash), so both connections of an app end up in the same device.

### Message via script

```typescript
// all devices that can show messages
sendTo('jellyfin.0', 'message', { text: 'Someone is at the door', header: 'Doorbell' });
// one device (object id or part of the device name)
sendTo('jellyfin.0', 'message', { text: 'Dinner is ready', device: 'SHIELD' }, (res) => log(JSON.stringify(res)));
```

The answer is `{ sent: <number of devices>, errors: [...] }`.

### Expert settings

Visible in the instance settings with the expert mode switched on: update interval (how often the server sends the playback status, default 5 s), cover height (default 300 px, 0 = original) and request timeout.
